# edge

i am trapped in the 4 corners of this world.  i wondered what luxury was like.  any bit of it i would take...  so yeah, this does feel stupid my whole body is stiff.  i dont know i dont think i would have done this willingly.  and you broke quite a bit of laws around me.  some day i will see a better day i bet.  its only natural.  but the dopamine hit of conclusion...

so yeah its just like this i wonder what we were doing and to this day nothing i ever did made any sense.  i'm just tagging along for the ride bro. i dont know again...  i forgot about things.  lets just look at the day objectively.  you feel the pain of hate when you experience it.  day time is like whatever bro.  nah this isn't working out.
